# Overview
Pixel art maker is a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

# Project Instructions
* [x] **Define the variables** by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. This is where the **JavaScript variables** can come into play! For instance, the submit button, the table, and the color picker need to be accessed. The value of the color selected needs to be stored as well, since the clicked cell in the table needs to be set to the selected color.
* [x] **Add event listeners** to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be dynamically set by the user.
* [x] ***Set the size of the cross stitch canvas** as an _N_ by _M_ grid with the `makeGrid()` function. Use my knowledge of JavaScript loops to dynamically clear and create the table based on user input. Each cell should have an event listener that sets the background color of the cell to the selected color.
